# Sponsors

If you are a company interested in sponsoring PHP× events, please let us know. There
are three ways to do so:

1. [Submit a PR directly](https://github.com/phpx-foundation/website/blob/main/resources/markdown/sponsors.md)
   adding your company name and who to contact to this list
2. [Join the PHP× Discord](https://discord.gg/wMy6Eeuwbu) and let us know of your interest there (we can
   add you to the list if submitting a PR is too technical)
3. If neither of those options work, you can email hello @ this domain and we'll try to help out. Email
   can be unreliable, though, so please use one of the above options if possible.

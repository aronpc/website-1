# Venues

If you are interested in hosting PHP× events, please let us know. There are three ways to do so:

1. [Submit a PR directly](https://github.com/phpx-foundation/website/blob/main/resources/markdown/venues.md)
   adding your venue info and who to contact to this list
2. [Join the PHP× Discord](https://discord.gg/wMy6Eeuwbu) and let us know about your venue there (we can
   add you to the list if submitting a PR is too technical)
3. If neither of those options work, you can email hello @ this domain, and we'll try to help out. Email
   can be unreliable, though, so please use one of the above options if possible.
